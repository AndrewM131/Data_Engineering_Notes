Data Engineering Notes

Data - Different Models or Transformations

Compression
-----------
All compression techniques create a model of what the data looks like, encode
the data in the model, and hope that the difference between the original and
reconstructed version is small enough to be unimportant.

Lossless Compression
--------------------
- Definition: This type of compression allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.
- Characteristics:
    - No data is lost during the compression process.
    - The decompressed data is identical to the original data.
- Examples:
    - ZIP: A common file format that supports lossless data compression.
    - PNG: A raster-graphics file format that supports lossless data compression.
    - FLAC: A lossless audio coding format for digital audio.
- Use Cases:
    - Text files, where any loss of data is unacceptable.
    - Medical imaging, where accuracy is critical.

Lossy Compression
-----------------
- Definition: This type of compression allows for some loss of data, which means the original data cannot be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.
- Characteristics:
    - Some data is lost during the compression process.
    - The decompressed data is not identical to the original data but is close enough for practical purposes.
- Examples:
    - JPEG: A commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images.
    - MP3: A coding format for digital audio that uses lossy compression.
    - MPEG: A standard for lossy compression of video and audio.
- Use Cases:
    - Multimedia files, where a perfect reconstruction is not necessary and some loss of quality is acceptable.
    - Streaming services, where bandwidth efficiency is important.

Conventions of Database Systems
-------------------------------
- Consistency: Ensures that a database remains in a consistent state, providing one correct answer to any query.
- Availability: Ensures that the database is available for queries and transactions when the client needs it, providing quick responses.
- Partition Tolerance: Ensures that the database system continues to operate despite network partitions, handling latency in the network.


Online Transaction Procession (OLTP)
Need Consistency
Usually at the cost of Availability
transaction simple, fast

Online Analysis Procession (OLAP)
Consistency not essential
transaction more complex, slow

Seperate high value data from low value data
-Seperate code from configuration
-configuration includes API keys
